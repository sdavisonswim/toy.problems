// Postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish notation) is an alternative way of representing algebra expressions. For example, take the following expression:

// 2 + 5 * 8
// This “normal” notation that we see everyday is called infix notation. Infix notation places its math operators in-between the numbers.

// Infix notation also has order of operations. The previous example will be interpreted as 2 + (5 * 8), because multiplication comes before addition. This makes it difficult to write a program to parse infix expressions.

// In contrast, postfix notation is much easier to parse, albeit it looks weird at first. Postfix notation places math operators after the numbers. For example, the previous infix example can be re-written in postfix notation like this:

// 2 5 8 * +
// This expression should be read from left to right, one number / operator at a time. In doing so, you must keep a stack of numbers that wait to be operated on.
